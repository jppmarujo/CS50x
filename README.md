# CS50x - Once upon a time
Once upon a time, there was a guy with no mathematical background, with a bachelor in Communication Sciences and in the third year of Law, who took a leap of faith into learning code. It was always something that interested him a lot, and that he saw as kind of 'magic'. He thought it was time he started being is own David Copperfield. 

Here it starts.

This is a repository for my journey on CS50x. Hope it shows improvements on my coding style, prowess and general algorithmic thinking.

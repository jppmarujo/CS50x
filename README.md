# CS50x
Once upon a time, there was a guy with no mathematical background, with a bachelor in Communication Sciences and in the third year of law, who took the leap of faith into learning code. It was always something that interested him a lot, and that he saw as kind of 'magic'. He thought it was time he started being is own David Copperfield. So here it starts.
A repository for my journey on CS50x. Hope it shows improvements on my coding style, prowess and general algorithmic thinking.
